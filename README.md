<b>Algorithmic Phainomena: DeepDream Convolutional Neural Networks with Rembrandt's Aristotle</b>

<i>"We must, in the next place, investigate the subject of the dream, and first inquire to which of the faculties of the soul it presents itself, i.e. whether the affection is one which pertains to the faculty of intelligence or to that of sense-perception; for these are the only faculties within us by which we acquire knowledge." -Aristotle, On Dreams</i>
